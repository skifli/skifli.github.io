      <p>
        The website is back, with new and improved code! Although its been that
        way for a while, only now have I redone blogs (around four months after
        the initial rewrite)! That being said, now the code is much more
        maintainable and it should become less of a chore to upgrade / fix bugs
        on the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, I'll hopefully be posting some useful tutorials on the website
        soon, so stay tuned! Oh and also, there are now some easter eggs on the
        website. Can you catch 'em all?
