            Woo! I finally got around to rewriting my website. I've been meaning to do this for a while now, but I had
            been putting it off because of other commitments. I'm glad I finally got around to it though, because I
            really like the new design. Even though it's not that different from the old one, it's a lot cleaner and
            I prefer it more.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rewrite also introduces some new pages, such as the photography page. I've not finished it yet as I
            wanted to put the new website live as soon as possible, but I'll be working on it over the next few days.
            I have a design in my mind, and I'm sure it'll look great once it's done.
        </p>

        <p>
            The JavaScript code is also a lot cleaner and more organised, which hopefully also further improves the
            maintainability of the website. Anyway, I'm going to keep this post short, but I hope you like the new
            design! Thank you for being here, y adi√≥s!
