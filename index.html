      <h1>Skifli</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, I'm skifli <i>(prounouced /skif-lee/)</i>. Welcome to my home
        away from home :3! I can code proficiently in way too many different
        programming languages but my favourite is most definitely C because when
        it works (which it doesn't always) it works well. My socials are on
        another page, feel free to follow them :).
      </p>

      <p>
        I am the lead developer of the
        <a href="https://exeme-project.github.io/exeme-lang" target="_blank"
          >Exeme Programming Language</a
        >, which you've never heard of because I made it. As well as this, I
        participate in the
        <a href="https://www.f1inschools.co.uk/" target="_blank"
          >F1 in Schools</a
        >
        competition in
        <a href="https://warpf1s.github.io" target="_blank">team WÎ”RP</a>. If
        you want to find out more about me, I would suggest looking at my
        <a href="https://github.com/skifli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, or
        viewing the projects page of this site.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am also addicted to speed-typing. My PB is currently
        <a
          href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/756509488617488394/1106186425990398002/tmp_6993fc69-01bc-4242-b977-dda92e4e5e41.png"

          >192WPM w/ 100% acc</a
        >, which is great if you ignore the fact that it was a 10 word test.
        Which you are going to, right :3!
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh also I play the piano (grade 5), and trumpet (grade 2). I also play
        Table Tennis for a club and badminton in my spare time (which I don't
        have a lot of :|).
      </p>

      <h2>Favourite Programming Language</h2>

      <p>
        As stated above,
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"
          target="_blank"
          >C</a
        >
        or <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">Go</a>. If it's interesting
        to you, I also code in LLVM IR,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a>,
        <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
          target="_blank"
          >JS</a
        >. I also dabble in some frameworks such as
        <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a>,
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>, and
        <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">React</a>. If you asked me a
        few years ago Python would have been my favourite (as it was basically
        the only language I knew back then), but I've come to love other
        programming languages since. As previously said I am also working on my
        own programming language, which may appear here once it becomes stable.
        Which will probably be after I die with all these exams :/.
      </p>

      <h2>Favourite IDE</h2>

      <p>
        I use VSCode for absolutely everything - C, Go, HTML, etc. The
        versatility of the IDE, coupled with the powerful extensions market is
        why I use it. I use the
        <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode" target="_blank"
          >Fira Code</a
        >
        font (ligatures enabled), because it looks great. In terms of theme, I
        use the
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme"
          target="_blank"
          >One Dark Pro</a
        >
        colour theme, and the
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme"
          target="_blank"
          >Material Icons</a
        >
        theme. I also set the font size to <i>13px</i> because I prefer it. The
        only time when I don't use VSCode is when I use CLion for debugging C /
        C++, since it is so much easier :).
      </p>

      <h2>Favourite Game</h2>

      <p>
        In my opinion,
        <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> is the
        best game (once you add a bunch of mods to improve performance :|). I am
        a long time Java player, and mostly play Bedwars and Skyblock on
        Hypixel. I use Bedrock for my survival world and my friend's skyblock
        co-op on CubeCraft.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also love playing
        <a
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/585420/Trailmakers/"
          target="_blank"
          >Trailmakers</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/"
          >Terraria</a
        >. I also like playing
        <a
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/TrackMania_Nations_Forever/"
          target="_blank"
          >Trackmania Nations Forever</a
        >
        is also really fun as it is free, and even though it is very old it has
        great graphics that can run on pretty much any PC (coughs on integrated
        graphics :/).

      <h2>Useful Apps</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/" target="_blank">Everything</a>.
            Searches across your whole PC at lightning-fast speeds to locate
            files. Useful if your files are a mess, like mine.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">Flux</a>. Changes
            the screen tint depending on the time. Helps with eye strain if you
            code late at night.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.mactype.net/" target="_blank">MacType</a>. Why
            can't the default Windows font be as smooth as this? Oh wait sorry I
            forgot, Microsoft doesn't care.
