        <h1>Skifli</h1>

        <p>Hello, I'm skifli <i>(prounouced /skif-lee/)</i>. I am a backend programmer, although sometimes I work on
            frontend projects (usually websites). I can code proficiently in 6 different programming languages, but my
            favourites are C++ and Go. This is because I <i>love</i> seeing code that has taken countless hours of my
            life perfectly execute without any flaws.</p>

        <p>I am the lead developer of the <a href="https://exeme-project.github.io/exeme-lang" target="_blank">Exeme
                Programming Language</a>. As well as this, I participate in the <a href="https://www.f1inschools.co.uk/"
                target="_blank">F1 in Schools</a> competition in <a href="https://skifli.github.io/warp-f1s"
                target="_blank">team WÎ”RP</a>.
            If you want to find out more about me, I would suggest
            looking at my <a href="https://github.com/skifli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, or viewing the
            projects page of this site.</p>

        <h2>Favourite Programming Language</h2>

        <p>As stated above, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank">C++</a> or <a
                href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">Go</a>. If it's interesting to you, I also code in
            <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"
                target="_blank">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JS</a>. If
            you asked me a few years ago Python would have been my favourite (as it was basically the only
            language I knew back then), but I've come to love other programming languages since. As previously said I am
            also working on my own programming language, which may appear here once it becomes stable.
        </p>

        <h2>Favourite IDE</h2>

        <p>I use VSCode for absolutely everything - C++, Go, HTML, etc. The versatility of the IDE, coupled
            with the powerful extensions market is why I use it. I use the <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode"
                target="_blank">Fira Code</a> font (ligatures
            enabled), because it looks great. In terms of theme, I use the <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme"
                target="_blank">One Dark Pro</a> colour theme, and the <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme"
                target="_blank">Material Icons</a> theme. I'm one of those people who likes things small, so I also set
            the font size to <i>13px</i>.</p>

        <h2>Favourite Game</h2>

        <p>
            In my opinion, <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> is the best game.
            I mainly play on Java edition, most of the time on a survival world or on a SMP with friends. I also
            sometimes do Bedwars and Skyblock on Hypixel. I do have Bedrock, but I don't use it much because of the
            hacker infestation problem.
        </p>

        <h2>Useful Apps</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/" target="_blank">Everything</a>. Searches across
                    your
                    whole PC at lightning-fast speeds to locate files. Useful if your files are a mess, like mine.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">Flux</a>. Changes the screen tint
                    depending on the time. Helps a lot if you code late at night.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.mactype.net/" target="_blank">MacType</a>. Why can't the Windows
                    default font be as smooth as this?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
