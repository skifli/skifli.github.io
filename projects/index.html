        <h1>Projects</h1>

        <p>
            Here are some of my featured projects. You can see more on my
            <a href="https://github.com/skifli" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Exeme Language - <a href="https://github.com/exeme-project/exeme-lang" target="_blank">GitHub</a></h2>

        <p>
            Exeme is a programming language that I am developing. It is a compiled language that focuses on simplicity,
            scalability, and performance. It is currently in development, and is not ready for use. It has been my main
            project for a while now, and I'm hoping to have at least an alpha version ready by then end of 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
            The compiler is written in C, and compiles to LLVM IR, which is in turn compiled by <a
                href="https://clang.llvm.org/" target="_blank">clang</a> to an executable. Once a beta version has been
            achieved, the compiler will be re-written in Exeme. The standard library is also written in LLVM IR, by
            myself.
        </p>

        <h2>Warp F1s - <a href="https://github.com/warpf1s/warpf1s.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a></h2>

        <p>
            One of the extra-curricular activities I do is <a href="https://www.f1inschools.com/" target="_blank">F1 in
                Schools</a>. Since I'm weirdly good at programming, I was the natural choice as the person to create our
            website. It is written in custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I think it looks good enough for the time I
            spent on it.
        </p>

        <h2>Snek - <a href="https://github.com/skifli/snek" target="_blank">GitHub</a></h2>

        <p>
            Snek is a snake game written in Python that runs entirely in your terminal. It is designed to look like a
            retro game from the early 80s. It currently is relatively very simple, however I am planning to possibly add
            more features such as levels if I have the time.
