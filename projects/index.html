                    Here are some of my featured projects. You can see more on my

                <h2>Exeme Language - <a href="https://github.com/exeme-project/exeme-lang" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Exeme is a programming language that I am developing. It is a compiled language that focuses on
                    simplicity,
                    scalability, and performance. It is currently in development, and is not ready for use. It has been
                    my main
                    project for a while now, and I'm hoping to have at least an alpha version ready by then end of 2024.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The compiler is written in C, and compiles to LLVM IR, which is in turn compiled by <a
                        href="https://clang.llvm.org/" target="_blank">clang</a> to an executable. Once a beta version
                    has been
                    achieved, the compiler will be re-written in Exeme. The standard library is also written in LLVM IR,
                    by
                    myself.

                <h2>Warp F1s - <a href="https://github.com/warpf1s/warpf1s.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a></h2>

                <p>
                    One of the extra-curricular activities I do is <a href="https://www.f1inschools.com/"
                        target="_blank">F1 in
                        Schools</a>. Since I'm weirdly good at programming, I was the natural choice as the person to
                    create our
                    website. It is written in custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I think it looks good enough for the
                    time I
                    spent on it.

                <h2>Snek - <a href="https://github.com/skifli/snek" target="_blank">GitHub</a></h2>

                <p>
                    Snek is a snake game written in Python that runs entirely in your terminal. It is designed to look
                    like a
                    retro game from the early 80s. It currently is relatively very simple, however I am planning to
                    possibly add
                    more features such as levels if I have the time.
