                    Hi there, thanks for being here :).
                </p>

                <h2>Technology & Software Development</h2>

                <p>
                    I've always been interested in technology since a young age. I started programming when I was around
                    11
                    years old, and I've been doing it ever since. I've worked with many different languages and
                    frameworks, but
                    by far my favourites are C and Rust; I also have used LLVM IR, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JS. On
                    top of that, I've
                    dabbled
                    in
                    some frameworks such as Astro, Next.js, and React. If you asked me a few years ago Python would have
                    been my
                    favourite (as it was basically the only language I knew back then), but I've come to love other
                    programming
                    languages since. Especially C - because it doesn't work all the time, but that just it makes it even
                    sweeter when it does.
                </p>

                <h2>F1 in Schools</h2>

                <p>
                    One of my favourite extra-curricular activities to do is F1 in Schools (if you can't tell already)!
                    I've been participating for
                    a few
                    years now, as part of <a href="https://warp-racing.com">team WARP</a>. I'm the Sponsorship &
                    Marketing
                    manager, and I also maintain our website. I find F1iS really fun, and it has taught me valuable life
                    skills. We are currently hoping to get to the 2026 World Finals, and who knows... maybe even get on
                    the podium? A long way away though.
                </p>

                <h2>Sports</h2>

                <p>
                    I'm an extremely sporty person, and I play Table Tennis competitively for my club. I find sports
                    cathartic, and Table Tennis is also one which requires quick reflexes and a strong mental game. I
                    used to play Tennis and do Swimming as well, however I had to stop due to an injury.
                </p>

                <h2>Music</h2>

                <p>
                    This is a hard one. I listen to a lot of music. A lot. I feel it allows me to relate to people, and
                    things, that I wouldn't be able to relate to otherwise. And that helps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also play the piano (grade 7), and trumpet (grade 2). I've been playing the piano for way too
                    long, but I
                    still enjoy it a lot. Speaking of which, I should probably be practising right now!
                </p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>

                <p>I've always liked photography, even though I don't have the best hardware for the job. I have a <a
                        href="https://www.pentaxforums.com/reviews/pentax-k-s1-review/image-quality.html"
                        target="_blank">Pentax
                        K-S1</a> which is pretty good for it's age - you can see some images on the photography page.
