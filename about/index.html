        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
            Hi there, thanks for being here. I'm Skifli, a full-stack developer from the UK.
        </p>

        <h2>Technology & Software Development</h2>

        <p>
            I've always been interested in technology since a young age. I started programming when I was around 11
            years old, and I've been doing it ever since. I've worked with many different languages and frameworks, but
            by far my favourites are C / Go. I also code in LLVM IR, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JS. I've also dabbled
            in
            some frameworks such as Astro, Next.js, and React. If you asked me a few years ago Python would have been my
            favourite (as it was basically the only language I knew back then), but I've come to love other programming
            languages since.
        </p>

        <h2>Hardware</h2>

        <p>
            I have a <a
                href="https://www.serversdirect.co.uk/p/1456339/lenovo-v530-15icr-core-i5-9400-8gb-1tb-hdd-windows-10-pro-desktop-pc"
                target="_blank">Lenovo V530-15ICR</a> desktop. It is pretty good, except for gaming since it has our
            beloved Intel Integrated Graphics. I did upgrade it to 16GB of RAM though, if that means anything at all.
            The 1TB HDD is nice, except for the fact that I barely use 100GB, and so I might have been better of with
            the 256GB SSD.
        </p>

        <p>
            Paired with that, I have an <a href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/monitors/gaming/nitro-kg1/pdp/UM.UX1EE.001"
                target="_blank">Acer KG241Q</a> monitor, which is ok for my activities but apparently isn't the best.
            I run it at 60Hz because it keeps overheating at 75Hz, which is amazing!
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/n100" target="_blank">One Plus Nord N100</a>, which isn't that
            great. However I got it for Â£100 new which was a steal, so if you take that into account it is amazing for
            the price. I got a 128GB Kingston SD Card for it, since the storage was too little for my needs.
        </p>

        <h2>F1 in Schools</h2>

        <p>
            One of my favourite extra-curricular activities to do is F1 in Schools. I've been participating for a few
            years now, as part of <a href="https://warpf1s.github.io">team WARP</a>. I'm the sponsorship & marketing
            manager, and I also maintain our website. I find F1s really fun, and it has taught me valuable life skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>

        <p>
            I'm an extremely sporty person, and I play Table Tennis competitively. I also play Badminton, however I've
            never entered a competition. I used to play Tennis and do Swimming, however I had to stop due to an injury.
            I also used to play Cricket, and it is still my favourite sport to watch.
        </p>

        <h2>Music</h2>

        <p>
            Some of my friends say I have questionable music taste, but I think it's pretty good. I listen to a lot of
            music, but my favourite artists are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5zixe6AbgXPqt4c1uSl94L"
                target="_blank">Connor Price</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Cd373x8qzC7SNUg5IToqp"
                target="_blank">BoyWithUke</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/164Uj4eKjl6zTBKfJLFKKK"
                target="_blank">JVKE</a>. As of writing this, according to my <a href="https://stats.fm/skifli"
                target="_blank">Spotistats</a>, my most listened to genres are 'sad rap', 'pop', and 'pop rap'. Oh and
            also 'covertronica', whatever the heck that is.</p>

        <p>
            I also play the piano (grade 6), and trumpet (grade 2). I've been playing the piano for way too long, but I
            still enjoy it a lot. Speaking of which, I should probably be practising right now!
        </p>

        <h2>Photography</h2>

        <p>I've always liked photography, even though I don't have the best hardware for the job. I have a <a
                href="https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/cameras/digital/az421" target="_blank">Kodak PixPro
                AZ421</a> which is a pretty good camera for the price, but I'd like to upgrade to a DSLR at some point.
            I also use my phone's camera, which isn't the best, but it's good enough for me. I use a third-party camera
            app to take photos in RAW, which I then (sometimes) edit later. You can see my photos on the photography
            page.
