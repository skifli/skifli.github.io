                    Hi there, thanks for being here.
                </p>

                <h2>Technology & Software Development</h2>

                <p>
                    I've always been interested in technology since a young age. I started programming when I was around
                    11
                    years old, and I've been doing it ever since. I've worked with many different languages and
                    frameworks, but
                    by far my favourites are C / Go. I also code in LLVM IR, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JS. I've also
                    dabbled
                    in
                    some frameworks such as Astro, Next.js, and React. If you asked me a few years ago Python would have
                    been my
                    favourite (as it was basically the only language I knew back then), but I've come to love other
                    programming
                    languages since.
                </p>

                <h2>Hardware</h2>

                <p>
                    I have a <a
                        href="https://www.serversdirect.co.uk/p/1456339/lenovo-v530-15icr-core-i5-9400-8gb-1tb-hdd-windows-10-pro-desktop-pc"
                        target="_blank">Lenovo V530-15ICR</a> desktop. It is pretty good, except for gaming since it has
                    our
                    beloved Intel Integrated Graphics. I did upgrade it to 16GB of RAM though, if that means anything at
                    all.
                    The 1TB HDD is nice, except for the fact that I barely use 100GB, and so I might have been better of
                    with
                    the 256GB SSD version.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Paired with that, I have an <a
                        href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/monitors/gaming/nitro-kg1/pdp/UM.UX1EE.001"
                        target="_blank">Acer KG241Q</a> monitor, which is ok for my activities but apparently isn't the
                    best.
                    I run it at 60Hz because it keeps overheating at 75Hz, which is amazing! I also have a UGEE screen
                    with pen input, but I don't use the pen part as much as I should. I can't find what the model number
                    is, but it is quite a bit smaller than my main monitor. It's still better than just one though.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have a <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/n100" target="_blank">One Plus Nord N100</a>, which
                    isn't that
                    great. However I got it for Â£100 new which was a steal, so if you take that into account it is
                    amazing for
                    the price. I got a 128GB Kingston SD Card for it, since the storage was too little for my needs.
                </p>

                <h2>F1 in Schools</h2>

                <p>
                    One of my favourite extra-curricular activities to do is F1 in Schools. I've been participating for
                    a few
                    years now, as part of <a href="https://warpf1s.github.io">team WARP</a>. I'm the sponsorship &
                    marketing
                    manager, and I also maintain our website. I find F1s really fun, and it has taught me valuable life
                    skills.
                </p>

                <h2>Sports</h2>

                <p>
                    I'm an extremely sporty person, and I play Table Tennis competitively. I also play Badminton,
                    however I've
                    never entered a competition. I used to play Tennis and do Swimming, however I had to stop due to an
                    injury.
                    I also used to play Cricket, and it is still my favourite sport to watch.
                </p>

                <h2>Music</h2>

                <p>
                    Some of my friends say I have questionable music taste, but I think it's pretty good. I listen to a
                    lot of
                    music, but my favourite artists are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5zixe6AbgXPqt4c1uSl94L"
                        target="_blank">Connor Price</a>, <a
                        href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Cd373x8qzC7SNUg5IToqp" target="_blank">BoyWithUke</a>,
                    and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/164Uj4eKjl6zTBKfJLFKKK" target="_blank">JVKE</a>. As of
                    writing this, according to my <a href="https://stats.fm/skifli" target="_blank">Spotistats</a>, my
                    most listened to genres are 'sad rap', 'pop', and 'pop rap'. Oh and
                    also 'covertronica', whatever the heck that is.</p>

                <p>
                    I also play the piano (grade 6), and trumpet (grade 2). I've been playing the piano for way too
                    long, but I
                    still enjoy it a lot. Speaking of which, I should probably be practising right now!
                </p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>

                <p>I've always liked photography, even though I don't have the best hardware for the job. I have a <a
                        href="https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/cameras/digital/az421" target="_blank">Kodak
                        PixPro
                        AZ421</a> which is a pretty good camera for the price, but I'd like to upgrade to a DSLR at some
                    point.
                    I also use my phone's camera, which isn't the best, but it's good enough for me. I use a third-party
                    camera
                    app to take photos in RAW, which I then (sometimes) edit later. You can see my photos on the
                    photography
                    page.
